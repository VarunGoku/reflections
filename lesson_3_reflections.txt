When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When we want to make the work available outside the local PC and accessible to other team members.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    It is more advantageous to pull changes manually as this alows us to isolate the our local work from the git repository and not interfere with it.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork refers to making a copy of the repository in a different GitHub account (may not necessarily be different account).
    Also we can find out who forked our repository as well.
    Clone is making a copy of a repository in GitHub to a local machine.
    Branch is making a separate commit history from the master in local machine or in GitHub.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    It alows us to have a local copy of the last working project code, which can be experimented and tweaked without interfering the main project in GitHub.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Need a Person who keeps track of all the changes and organises work accordingly. It would have been a lot harder without GitHub.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    When we want to make experimental changes without disturbing the main project.
    Or if we are working on a different feature or version which we don't want to be accessible to others without completing it.
